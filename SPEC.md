# Boustrophedon — Build Specification

> Portfolio app 112, batch pending. This document is the complete brief for
> building this application. Read all of it before writing any code. Anything
> not specified here is your decision, but must stay consistent with section 3.

**One-line positioning:** Tap each backward word on a saved painting's maker or title.

## 1. Non-negotiable constraints

1. **No CocoaPods.** Dependencies come from Swift Package Manager, a local
   in-repo package, a vendored source folder, or nothing at all — per section 3.
2. **No shared code with other portfolio apps.** Business rules are re-implemented
   here under this app's own type names.
3. **All code, identifiers, comments, UI copy and the README are in English.**
4. **No launch gate, no WebView shell, no remote configuration, no analytics.**
   Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): this is a native SwiftUI product, not
   a web browsing experience. WKWebView / SFSafariViewController as UI is a
   reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make a
   browser or a thin catalog into an App Store app.
5. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy):** never direct the user to grant camera access.
   A pre-permission screen may exist; the proceed button is **Continue** or
   **Next**, never "Allow camera", "Enable camera", "Grant camera", or a bare
   Allow/Enable that triggers `requestAccess`. The system alert is the only Allow.
6. **No CI files.** No `bitrise.yml`, no `Scripts/`, no `metadata/` folder.
7. **Assets are AI-generated.** No stock photography. SF Symbols may support
   small affordances but must never be the primary iconography.
8. **The app must build clean** with
   `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme Boustrophedon -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`.
9. **Nothing may echo another app in this batch** in naming, layout or visuals.
10. **This is not a calorie meal-slot tracker** unless family is `food_tracker`.
   Do not invent food logging to fill the brief.

## 2. Product core

The product is offline-first. No account, no sign-in, no ads, no in-app purchase,
no analytics SDK, no remote config. All user data stays on the device.

A visitor taps each backward-spelled word on the caption so the saved painting shelves as faced.

### 2.1 User flow

1. Tap a backward-spelled word on the furrow
2. Save another work from Explore so it can enter the turn pool
3. Open Saved to see faced paintings and reviewable yaws
4. Retract the newest FaceMark or YawMark
5. Open Settings to read the National Gallery credit

### 2.2 Essential behaviour

- Quiz draws only from saved works
- A Furrow is artist XOR title with every other Stichos letter-reversed
- Face rights retrograde words until the last FaceMark files Faced
- Misses write reviewable YawMarks and keep the Furrow
- Explore, Saved and Settings arrive as sheets; Quiz never leaves
- Local only, no shop, no grade field
- One collection voice: The National Gallery, London

### 3.0 Product concept

This is the product the contracts below are assigned to. Do not substitute another.

**Family** — art_quiz

**Core** — A visitor taps each backward-spelled word on the caption so the saved painting shelves as faced.

**Audience** — People who already saved museum paintings and want to face each retrograde word on a maker or title line, on this device, not swap two words, not prick letter gaps, and not walk a museum site.

**User flow**

1. Tap a backward-spelled word on the furrow
2. Save another work from Explore so it can enter the turn pool
3. Open Saved to see faced paintings and reviewable yaws
4. Retract the newest FaceMark or YawMark
5. Open Settings to read the National Gallery credit

**Essential features**

- Quiz draws only from saved works
- A Furrow is artist XOR title with every other Stichos letter-reversed
- Face rights retrograde words until the last FaceMark files Faced
- Misses write reviewable YawMarks and keep the Furrow
- Explore, Saved and Settings arrive as sheets; Quiz never leaves
- Local only, no shop, no grade field
- One collection voice: The National Gallery, London

**Twist** — Turn-then-face. Home is the furrow. Turn pulls one painting that is still loose and whose maker name or picture title holds two or more words, then paints those words as a Furrow where every other Stichos runs retrograde, letters reversed. Tapping a retrograde Stichos records a FaceMark and faces that word. Tapping a word that already reads forward records a YawMark; the Furrow stays ox-turned. Facing does nothing before Turn. A second Turn during an open Furrow is refused. Explore saves a painting as loose; the same object id only brings that row forward. Faced paintings move to Saved and leave Turn. Undo peels the newest face or yaw. Turn on an empty crate prints Level. First launch already shows an ox-turned caption, so the opening tap can face a word. The job on home is face-the-furrow. Saved lists FaceMarks and YawMarks. Settings credits the National Gallery, London. Grades and a shop stay out.

**Why this is not a repeat** — Home verb is face-the-furrow: every other token of artist XOR title is letter-reversed in place, and each retrograde Stichos must be faced before the work files. That is not right-the-sort (adjacent words change seats), not prick-the-gap (scriptio continua), not keep-the-undertext (foreign overtext), not stack-the-drum (reading order from a shuffle), and not split-the-kollesis (one seam between two fields). Screens stay Explore, Saved, Quiz, Settings with Quiz locked. The National Gallery, London is an unused collection voice. Closed axes reuse SwiftUI pure / Soft card daylight / 3D glass with free take-tokens artquiz10 and artquiz6.

### 3.0a Craft from the shipped portfolio

Full craft is in KNOWLEDGE.md. Follow it. Do not copy type names or layouts.
- Home: Explore → saved → quiz artist or title.
- Invariant: Quiz draws from saved works. Misses are reviewable. Collecting without a test is the crate clone.
- Never: One collection voice. No shop.
- Taste DNA is section 7.6. Do not invent a second look.
- A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

### 3.1 Architecture contract

Boustrophedon is a closed algebraic fold with cases Idle, Turned, and Faced; a fourth case is a defect. The furrow is a fold over Works: Turn samples one saved Work that is not Faced whose chosen field has at least two tokens, writes a Furrow that is artist XOR title with every other Stichos letter-reversed in place (0-based odd indices reverse their letters, even indices stay catalog-forward), and folds Idle to Turned; Turn on an empty crate or a field with fewer than two tokens writes Level; a second Turn while Turned is refused; Faced works leave the turn pool for Saved. Face writes a FaceMark when the tapped Stichos is still retrograde and rights that word on the Furrow; a miss writes a YawMark, cools that Stichos, and keeps the same ox-turned Furrow; Face on Idle is refused; the last remaining retrograde Face folds Turned to Faced. Retract peels the newest FaceMark or YawMark so a FaceMark returns Faced to Turned and the turn pool and un-rights that Stichos, and a YawMark reheats that Stichos; Explore writes a Work as Idle with daykey Int YYYYMMDD from Calendar.current.startOfDay while a repeated object id focuses the existing row and does not reset Boustrophedon. One observable FurrowStore pattern-matches the fold; views call turnFurrow, faceStichos, yawStichos, and retractNewestMark and never keep a second boustrophedon enum; unit tests prove not-Faced sampling, two-token gate, artist-XOR-title Furrow with odd-index letter reversal, Face-on-Idle refuse, second-Turn-while-Turned refuse, miss keep, last-Face fold, Retract fold-back, Faced leaving the pool, duplicate focus, Level, and that Quiz draws only from saved works with YawMarks reviewable on Saved.

Put a short comment block at the top of each principal type stating the role it
plays in this architecture. The README must justify the pattern for this product.

### 3.2 UI contract

100 percent SwiftUI, Light. No UIViewRepresentable, no WKWebView, no Safari sheet, no camera preview, no TabView. The ui axis restates SwiftUI pure with take-token artquiz10: leftover closed-axis take, so compose an original ox-plough furrow of stichoi, not a hanging plaque, not a ruined drum column, not a companion rack, not a gap-prick slab, not a gloss rail, not a headed remainder row, not a mixed undertext folio, not a glued volumen, not a four-canvas hang, and not a name-chip easel. Do not copy holder file trees, type names, or layouts. Do not ship a title screen named Boustrophedon. Home is the mechanic: Quiz is the furrow filling remaining height and the iPad width, a photography-first hero tile of the Work with the ox-turned Furrow caption under the tile not on it, a rail of tappable Stichoi, a recent Faced rail, and one secondary FaceMark YawMark stat as uneven 2 plus 1. Turn and Face fuse on that furrow; Turn does not auto-advance after Faced. Confine custom drawing to that one Quiz hero (Shape, Path, one Material on the furrow tray); Explore, Saved, and Settings are stock sheets (List, Form). Taste is already Soft card daylight take artquiz6: kit radius 20 and radius_small 12, shadow elevation, soft-card controls, hero-rail 2+1, snap motion. Do not add a second glass UI kit or a second radius language. Soft shadow only on the hero tile; every other surface is flat fill. Primary Face uses a ButtonStyle with default, pressed, disabled, and loading. resetAllData uses the destructive variant. Stichoi, Retract, and sheet rows are native Buttons with contentShape, min 44pt, one target on the whole chrome. Empty Quiz (Level), empty Explore, and empty Saved are full pages (frame maxHeight infinity) with generated cutout art, one headline, one line, and a bottom full-width CTA. Snap motion: press scale 0.97 in 140 to 180ms ease-out, sheets scale 0.96 to 1 plus fade; Reduce Motion is opacity only. Colour is never the only miss signal; a miss also cools the Stichos and does not right it. One haptic on a successful FaceMark, none on YawMark, none on presenting a sheet. VoiceOver labels on every icon-only sheet control. Warm voice, short display, no em dash, no emoji. The ui axis string is never a section title.

### 3.3 Naming contract

Convention: Boustrophedon / ox-plough lexicon.

Examples to follow: `Boustrophedon`, `FaceMark`, `turnFurrow()`, `faceStichos()`

### 3.4 Dependency contract

None. project.yml has no packages key. No SPM, no CocoaPods, no bundled font. SF Pro is the system face. Foundation, SwiftUI, and URLSession only. The leftover AVCaptureMetadataOutput scanner stays unused: do not import AVFoundation or Vision for capture, do not request camera access, and do not ship NSCameraUsageDescription beyond the identity string that the app does not use the camera. Honor the cgi search pl assignment as paginated JSON search: query, json, page, page_size mapped onto GET https://query.wikidata.org/sparql with query and format=json, LIMIT page_size, OFFSET (page minus 1) times page_size, filtered to items whose collection (P195) is the National Gallery, London (Q180788) and that carry a maker (P170) plus a title (P1476 or English label) plus an image (P18), then hydrate each Q-id with GET https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/{id}.json. Never call world.openfoodfacts.org or /cgi/search.pl. Never Open Food Facts, calories, meal slots, or a food catalog. Never api.artic.edu, collectionapi.metmuseum.org, openaccess-api.clevelandart.org, api.harvardartmuseums.org, www.rijksmuseum.nl, api.nga.gov, www.nga.gov, data.getty.edu, media.getty.edu, api.thewalters.org, lux.collections.yale.edu, search.artsmia.org, api.vam.ac.uk, www.brooklynmuseum.org, or www.tate.org.uk. Never filter P195 to Q214867, Q510324, Q49133, Q1327915, or Q49135. Dedicated JSONDecoder with useDefaultKeys. DTO CodingKeys map Wikidata bindings and EntityData (id, P170, P1476, P217, P18, labels) without convertFromSnakeCase, then map to domain Work. Identity is the National Gallery inventory in P217, else the Q-id. Maker is P170. Title is P1476 or the English label. Prefer a non-empty maker, a non-empty title, a P18 file, and a chosen field that still has two or more tokens after split. Thumbs use https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/{filename}?width=843. Set User-Agent Boustrophedon/1.0 (iOS; +https://boustrophedon-furrow.pro) on every request. Debounce search about 500 ms, cancel the previous Task, empty query does not hit the network. Cache resolved works locally so empty or failed search still turns from the bundled Gallery shelf. Settings credits the National Gallery, London as tappable source links (https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk and https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings).

### 3.5 Navigation contract

Furrow-locked chrome: Quiz is the root ox-plough line and never leaves. There is no TabView and no pushed museum detail. Turn, Face on a Stichos, and Retract fuse on Quiz. Explore, Saved, and Settings arrive as sheets over the furrow. Four destinations, never exactly three tabs. App Intents open Quiz, Explore, Saved, or Settings, or fire turnFurrow or faceStichos in place. Custom URL scheme boustrophedon routes boustrophedon://quiz, boustrophedon://explore, boustrophedon://saved, boustrophedon://settings, and the matching https://boustrophedon-furrow.pro paths into those same jobs. One haptic on a successful FaceMark, none on presenting a sheet. Contact URL https://boustrophedon-furrow.pro/contact-us lives on Settings. Retract is also reachable from Settings. After onboarding, read ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments once: -ReviewScreen today stays on Quiz, log presents Saved, goals presents Settings. Extra key explore presents Explore. Skip onboarding on Simulator after the bph.demo.v1 seed so the hook can fire.

### 3.6 Screen composition contract

Furrow-root fused quiz (Quiz holds the painting and the ox-turning line of stichoi; Explore, Saved and Settings are sheets). Physical screens: Quiz, Explore, Saved, Settings. Quiz is the locked ox-plough furrow (ReviewScreen today): Turn samples a Work that is not Faced and posts a Furrow of Stichoi with every other token letter-reversed; Face rights a retrograde Stichos; Retract peels the newest FaceMark or YawMark; status shows Idle, Turned, Faced, Level. Explore is a sheet that searches the National Gallery, London and writes an Idle Work, with a local Gallery shelf when search is empty or fails (deep link explore). Saved is a sheet of Faced works plus reviewable YawMarks, and it counts FaceMarks plus YawMarks (ReviewScreen log). Settings is a Form for National Gallery, London credit, Retract, contact URL at https://boustrophedon-furrow.pro/contact-us, re-run onboarding, and resetAllData (ReviewScreen goals). Onboarding is a one-shot cover of three pages with Continue or Next at the bottom full width. Empty Quiz with no turnable Work is Level as a full page: generated cutout art, headline Crate level., one line Save a work, then face., full-width bottom Explore. Empty Explore and empty Saved are full pages of their own. Seeded Quiz already posts an ox-turned Furrow so the first Stichos tap can file; Level is a test fixture, not the first frame. No Today, Scan, Search, or Goals screens. ReviewScreen today, log, and goals must open three different screens.

Section 5 lists the logical functions that must exist. This section decides how
they are grouped into actual screens. Where the two disagree, this section wins.

A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

## 4. Target file organization

Scheme: **By furrow role (Furrow, Work, Stichos, FaceMark, YawMark, Turn)**

```

  Furrow/
  Furrow.swift
  Boustrophedon.swift
  FurrowStore.swift

Adapt the leaf files to the architecture, but the top-level shape is fixed. Do
not create a `Utils/` or `Helpers/` dumping ground.

---

## 5. Screens

Build the screens named in section 3.6. The labels below are logical;
actual type names follow this app's naming convention.

### 5.1 Onboarding
Three to four pages. Explains the product, writes initial settings, sets a
completion flag. Skip still writes sensible defaults. Re-runnable from Settings.

### 5.2 Explore
A first-class screen for **Explore**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.3 Saved
A first-class screen for **Saved**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.4 Quiz
A first-class screen for **Quiz**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.5 Settings
A first-class screen for **Settings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.6 Settings
Holds: re-run onboarding, reset all data (confirmed), and the contact link to
the domain contact-us URL.

### 5.7 Twist screen
See section 12. The twist needs at least one screen of its own plus a surface on the home screen.


---

## 6. Domain model

Minimum entities, named per this app's convention:

- **Work** — named per this app's convention.
- **QuizCard** — named per this app's convention.
- Plus whatever the twist in section 12 requires.


---

## 7. Design system

Direction: **Soft card daylight · take artquiz6**

### 7.1 Palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FAF7F5` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#FEFEFD` | Cards, rows, sheets |
| `ink` | `#392818` | Primary text and icons |
| `accent` | `#CC6D19` | Primary action, key figure, progress fill |
| `muted` | `#816C5A` | Secondary text, dividers, disabled |

Define these as named colours in `Assets.xcassets` and reach them through one
typed accessor. Never hard-code a hex string anywhere else.

### 7.2 Typography

Family: **SF Pro**

SF Pro via Font.system as the hospitable short-display type move from Soft card daylight: display is at most four words (Face, Turn, Level), tight leading, one or two lines, about 2x body, never above 34pt. Body is about 17pt under the photo tile for the ox-turned Furrow of Stichoi. Caption sits under the painting tile, not on it, and names Idle, Turned, Faced, Level. At most six named steps behind one accessor: display, title, headline, body, caption, micro. Weights and step carry hierarchy. No Font.custom, no fixedSize, never below 12pt, no serif, no second family. FaceMark counts, YawMark counts, and day keys go through NumberFormatter with tabular figures. Dynamic Type; at AX5 Face may drop a step so it never clips; names truncate, numbers win. Day edges use Calendar.current.startOfDay then fold to Int YYYYMMDD.

Define a type scale of at most six steps behind one accessor and use only those
steps. Text stays legible at the largest Dynamic Type size.

### 7.3 Layout

- One base spacing unit (4 or 8 pt); only multiples of it.
- Corner radius and elevation are fixed by section 7.4, not chosen per screen.
- Every interactive element is at least 44x44 pt.

### 7.4 Component contract

Corner radius: **20pt** for cards, sheets and primary surfaces; **12pt** for chips, badges and small controls. Reach both through one accessor. Never a bare literal number, and never zero — a hard edge is not this app's design direction.

Elevation: **shadow** — a single soft drop-shadow token, reused everywhere a surface sits above another.

Primary control: **soft card** — primary actions live inside a rounded card using the radius below, not a flat row with no fill.

This is arithmetic, not a suggestion: every card, sheet, chip and button in this app uses these two radii and this elevation style. Do not introduce a second radius or a second elevation style.

This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

### 7.5 Custom rendering scope

This app's `ui` axis is **SwiftUI pure · take artquiz10**.

If that approach uses anything beyond stock SwiftUI/UIKit controls — `Canvas`, `CALayer`, Metal, SceneKit, SpriteKit, RealityKit, a hand-drawn `UIViewRepresentable`, or any other pixel-level custom rendering — confine it to exactly one hero surface on one screen (the mechanic's home view, or the one screen this axis exists to showcase). Every other screen — every list, every settings screen, every sheet, every secondary surface — is built from stock components: `List`, `Form`, `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, `Button`, `.sheet`, native `Text`/`Image`. A second custom-rendered surface elsewhere in the app is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

If **SwiftUI pure · take artquiz10** is already fully native (no custom drawing layer), this section is satisfied automatically — there is nothing to confine.

The `ui` axis value is an implementation choice. It must never appear as a user-visible section title or label.

This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

### 7.6 Taste DNA

Aesthetic: **warm** (Warm soft: friendly radii, comfortable pad, one playful moment.)

Reference system: **airbnb** — steal rhythm and restraint, not their colours or logos.

Mood: **hospitable**.

Home rhythm (`hero-rail`, comfortable): One large photo-tile mechanic, a recent rail, one secondary stat. Uneven 2+1.

Photography-first home. Caption sits under the tile, not on it. Pill CTA. Soft shadow only on the hero; every other surface is flat fill.

Type move: Short display (max four words), tight leading, small body under it.

Motion (`snap`): Press scale 0.97, 140-180ms ease-out. Sheets scale 0.96 to 1 plus fade. Reduce Motion: opacity only.

Voice (`warm`): Human and brief. Empty states invite. Errors stay calm and useful.

Anti-slop from KNOWLEDGE.md applies. Taste never overrides contrast, 44pt hits, VoiceOver labels, or Reduce Motion.

This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

## 8. UI and UX quality bar

Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Do not treat this as advice.

**Layout**

- Respect safe areas on every screen. Nothing sits under the notch, the Dynamic
  Island or the home indicator.
- The app is portrait-only on iPhone. Lock it in the Info settings and do not
  write rotation-dependent layout.
- No layout shift when asynchronous data arrives. Reserve the final size up
  front, or use a redacted placeholder of the same dimensions.
- Long product names must truncate gracefully, never push a number off screen.
  Numbers win; names truncate.
- Minimum tap target 44x44 pt for every interactive element, including small
  icon buttons and list accessories.
- Pick one base spacing unit and use only multiples of it. No arbitrary values.

**Keyboard**

- The grams field uses `.decimalPad`, and the decimal separator matches the
  user's locale.
- Content scrolls out from under the keyboard. The focused field is always
  visible.
- Tapping outside the field, or scrolling, dismisses the keyboard.
- Validate on the fly: reject negative and non-numeric input rather than
  crashing the parser later.

**Loading and state**

- Every asynchronous operation has a visible loading state.
- Guard against the spinner flash: if the work finishes in under 150 ms, do not
  show a spinner at all.
- Every list has a designed empty state containing a primary action, not just a
  sentence of text.
- Every error state offers a retry, and states plainly what failed.
- Disable the primary button while its action is in flight so it cannot be
  double-tapped into a double push or a duplicate entry.

**Typography and accessibility**

- All text scales with Dynamic Type. Verify at the largest accessibility size:
  nothing may clip or overlap.
- Every icon-only control has an `accessibilityLabel`. Decorative images are
  marked as decorative so VoiceOver skips them.
- Colour is never the only signal. Pair it with a label, a shape or an icon.
- Honour Reduce Motion: replace movement-heavy transitions with a fade.
- Meet contrast requirements against the palette in section 7. Check the muted
  colour against the background specifically; that is where these palettes fail.

**Formatting**

- Format every number with `NumberFormatter`, never string interpolation. Group
  separators and decimal separators must follow the locale.
- Energy is shown as a whole number of kcal. Macros are shown with at most one
  decimal place.
- Round only at the point of display. Stored values keep full precision.
- Day boundaries use `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:)` in the user's current
  time zone. Handle the day changing while the app is open, and handle the
  short and long days that daylight saving produces.
- Unknown macro values render as a dash or the word "unknown", never as 0.

**Motion and feedback**

- One haptic on a successful commit (a food logged, a target saved). No haptic
  on navigation.
- Animations are short (0.2 to 0.35 s) and use a single shared easing curve.
- Nothing animates on first appearance of a screen except an intentional entry
  transition.

**Navigation**

- Back always works and never loses entered data without asking.
- A destructive action (delete a log row, reset all data) is confirmed.
- Modal sheets can always be dismissed; there is no dead end.
- Deep state is restorable: relaunching returns the user to a sane screen.


Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Section 7.4 fixed the numbers —
this is where they have to show up on screen.

**Hierarchy and density**

- Every screen has exactly one dominant element (a hero number, a canvas, a
  primary card) that the eye lands on first. A screen where every element has
  equal weight reads as a spreadsheet, not a product.
- Related content is grouped into a card or a section with the elevation
  style from 7.4, not left floating on the bare background.
- Unused flat background is not "minimal" — see the density rule in
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`. If a screen has room left after the mechanic and the
  content, add a secondary surface (a stat strip, a recent-activity card, a
  related-item row), not a `Spacer`.

**Components**

- Every card, sheet, chip, row and button in the app uses the corner radius
  and elevation from section 7.4. No screen introduces its own radius or its
  own shadow value "just for this one card".
- Buttons have a pressed state (`ButtonStyle` with a scale or opacity change
  on `isPressed`) and a disabled state that is visibly different, not just
  non-interactive.
- Chips and badges are pill or rounded-rect shaped per 7.4, never a bare
  `Text` with no background sitting where a control is expected.
- A functional control (add, filter, sort, close, more, share, delete) is an
  SF Symbol inside a properly hit-targeted `Button`. SF Symbols are fine and
  expected here — section 16 only bans them as the app's primary brand
  iconography (app icon, empty-state hero, onboarding art), which is what the
  generated assets in section 13 are for.

**Depth and material**

- At least one surface in the app (a sheet, a modal, a floating toolbar) uses
  the elevation style from 7.4 to visibly sit above the content behind it.
  A flat app with no depth anywhere reads as a wireframe.
- Icons and generated art sit on the surface colour from 7.1, never directly
  on a colour that makes their edges disappear.

**Motion as feedback, not decoration**

- The one dominant element in a screen (7.4's primary control, the mechanic's
  hero) responds visibly to touch: a scale, a colour shift, a haptic — pick
  at least one. A control that looks identical pressed and unpressed reads as
  broken, not calm.

**Taste DNA (section 7.6)**

- Home uses the assigned layout family and density. Three identical equal-weight
  cards, a leftover bento hole, or a second column structure copied down the
  page is a defect.
- Copy follows the assigned voice. No em-dash, no elevate/unlock/seamless, no
  emoji, no SECTION 01 labels.
- Motion follows the assigned personality and honours Reduce Motion with a fade.
  One signature motion per view. No glow stacked on glass stacked on spring.
- Tokens by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not wear primary.


---

## 9. Concurrency

The target builds with Swift 6.2 and `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`. It
must compile with **zero concurrency warnings**. Warnings here become crashes
later, so they are not negotiable.

- All UI types are `@MainActor`. Annotate the type, not individual methods.
- Any value crossing an actor boundary is `Sendable`. Prefer immutable structs
  of primitives.
- Do not use `@unchecked Sendable`. If it is genuinely unavoidable, it needs a
  comment explaining what guarantees the safety.
- No mutable global state. No `static var` that is written after launch.
- Networking and storage APIs are `async` and honour cancellation. When the
  search query changes, cancel the in-flight task; do not let a stale response
  overwrite fresh results.
- Use structured concurrency. Avoid `Task.detached` unless there is a stated
  reason. Never fire a `Task` that outlives the view without owning it.
- Never use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to paper over an ordering problem.
  Fix the ordering.
- `Timer` and notification observers are invalidated in `deinit` or on
  disappear.

## 10. Persistence engineering

Chosen technology: **UserDefaults+Codable**

One Codable FurrowDocument (schemaVersion from 1, Works with Boustrophedon Idle Turned or Faced, live Furrow, Stichoi, FaceMarks, YawMarks, cached catalog rows, daykeys as Int YYYYMMDD) encoded to JSON Data in UserDefaults under bph.furrow.v1. Boustrophedon case is stored; faced-ness is not a parallel bool. Level is a turn write, not a stored Work case. In-memory FurrowStore is the source of truth; UserDefaults is the projection. Views never touch UserDefaults. Debounce writes. Flush when scenePhase becomes inactive or background, and after Turn, FaceMark, YawMark, Retract, Explore save, or reset. Decoding failure falls back to bph.furrow.v1.backup, then an empty furrow, never a crash. resetAllData() is reachable from Settings. Tests use a private UserDefaults suite. Simulator seed only once behind bph.demo.v1 writes several Works from the local Gallery shelf, a mix of Idle Turned and Faced, several YawMarks so Saved is a used product, posts one multi-token Furrow with odd-index Stichoi already letter-reversed so Face is live, marks onboarding complete, and never seeds Level as the first frame. Never seed on a device. Cached works catch empty or failed National Gallery search.

This app persists to **files on disk**. The following are mandatory.

- Write atomically. Either `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` or write to a
  temporary file and `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. A non-atomic write that is
  interrupted leaves a truncated file and the app will not launch.
- Create the containing directory with
  `withIntermediateDirectories: true` before the first write.
- Every document carries a `schemaVersion` field from version 1, and the decoder
  switches on it.
- Decoding failure must be recoverable: keep the previous good file as a
  `.backup`, fall back to it, and if that also fails start from empty state and
  tell the user. Never crash on a corrupt file.
- All file IO happens off the main thread. The main thread never blocks on disk.
- Debounce writes during rapid edits, but force a flush when `scenePhase`
  becomes `.inactive` or `.background`, and after any destructive action.
- Exclude caches from backup with `URLResourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup` where
  appropriate; user data belongs in Application Support and should be backed up.
- Keep an explicit in-memory source of truth and treat the file as a projection
  of it, so a failed write never leaves the UI showing data that does not exist.


Regardless of technology:

- One seam between domain logic and storage; the UI never touches storage types.
- Writes survive a force-quit. Do not rely on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- Provide `resetAllData()`, used by tests and reachable from Settings.

---

## 11. Networking

- One client type owns both Open Food Facts endpoints.
- Set `User-Agent` on every request. Open Food Facts throttles clients that do
  not identify themselves.
- 15 second timeout. One retry on a transient transport failure, then a typed
  error. Do not retry a 404.
- Cancel the in-flight search when the query changes. Debounce input by roughly
  300 ms.
- Decode into DTO types that mirror the JSON exactly, then map to domain types.
  Never decode straight into your domain model.
- Dedicated `JSONDecoder` with `.useDefaultKeys`. Never `convertFromSnakeCase` —
  Open Food Facts keys like `energy-kcal_100g` break snake_case conversion.
- Resolve a scanned code with `GET /api/v2/product/<barcode>.json`, not a search.
- Open Food Facts data is user-contributed and frequently incomplete. Every
  numeric field is optional. A product with no energy value is a normal case
  that the UI must present, not an error.
- Some numeric fields arrive as strings. The decoder must accept both a number
  and a numeric string for every nutriment.
- `status` of `0` in the product response means not found. Map it to a distinct
  error case so the UI can offer manual entry.
- Never crash on malformed JSON. A decoding failure is a handled error.
- Cache every resolved product locally on success, so the app degrades to a
  working offline catalogue.


Set `User-Agent: Boustrophedon/1.0 (iOS; +https://boustrophedon-furrow.pro)` on every request. Never reuse another app's string.
Use the **cgi search pl** search endpoint for this app.

---

## 11b. App Store readiness

The app must be submittable without further work.

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the target, declaring the UserDefaults access API
  reason `CA92.1` and the file timestamp reason `C617.1`, with
  `NSPrivacyTracking` false and no collected data types.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` in the pbxproj so TestFlight
  does not sit on Missing Compliance.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` written specifically for this app. Generic strings
  get rejected.
- `LSApplicationCategoryType` of `public.app-category.healthcare-fitness`.
- Portrait only, iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).
- No account, no sign-in, no delete-account flow, no in-app purchase, no ads, no
  user-generated content, and therefore no report or block UI.
- App Tracking Transparency is never invoked.
- The camera is the only sensitive permission requested.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy): do not encourage or direct the user to grant camera
  access. A pre-permission screen may exist, but the proceed button must be
  **Continue** or **Next** — never "Allow camera", "Enable camera",
  "Grant camera", or a bare Allow/Enable that calls `requestAccess`. The
  system dialog is the only Allow. Denied/restricted offers Open Settings.
- The app must not present itself as a clinician or as medical advice.
- Guideline 4.2 (Design — Minimum Functionality): the binary must be a native
  product, not a web browsing experience. No WKWebView / SFSafariViewController
  / UIWebView as home, a tab, or the primary UX. A content catalog, article
  reader, or site wrapper that could be a website is a reject. Push
  notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make that acceptable.
- Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety — Physical Harm): if the binary shows health or
  medical recommendations, body-based targets, dosages, "you should" guidance,
  or product health claims (food, drink, supplement, remedy), put citations
  in the app. Tappable links to the sources, easy to find: same screen as the
  claim, or a Sources row one tap from Settings. Name the source (Open Food
  Facts, USDA FoodData Central, WHO, NIH MedlinePlus, …) and link it. A
  "not medical advice" footer without sources is a reject. A personal log
  that never advises does not invent claims to cite.
- Nutrition catalog data is credited to the database this app actually uses
  (Open Food Facts unless the spec names another). Credit is a tappable link,
  not a dead "OpenFoodFacts" label.


Ignore the food-log and Open Food Facts lines above when they conflict with this
family. Category for this app is `public.app-category.education`. Camera permission only if the
product actually captures.

Project settings that follow from the above:

```yaml
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIUserInterfaceStyle: Light
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPad: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIRequiresFullScreen: YES
INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: NO
INFOPLIST_KEY_LSApplicationCategoryType: public.app-category.education
TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"
SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete
```

## 12. Functional twist: Turn-then-face (Turn samples a Work that is not Faced whose chosen field has at least two tokens; a Furrow is artist XOR title with every other Stichos letter-reversed; Face writes a FaceMark when the tapped Stichos is retrograde and rights it; a miss writes a YawMark and keeps the Furrow; the last true Face folds Turned to Faced; Face on Idle is refused; Turn on a field with fewer than two tokens is refused)

Home is face-the-furrow: Turn samples one saved Work that is not Faced and whose chosen field has at least two tokens, then paints those words as a Furrow that is maker or title, never both, with every other Stichos letter-reversed in place, so the opening tap files when it hits a retrograde word, not an adjacent-sort swap, not a missing-space prick, not a mixed undertext keep, not a restacked drum, and not a field-seam split. Every Stichos on that Furrow is tappable; Face writes a FaceMark when the tapped Stichos is still retrograde and rights it; a miss writes a YawMark and the Furrow stays ox-turned; Face while Idle is refused; a second Turn while Turned is refused; Turn on a field with fewer than two tokens is refused. The last remaining retrograde Face folds Turned to Faced so that work leaves the turn pool and rests on Saved; misses stay reviewable as YawMarks. Explore stores a Work Idle from the National Gallery, London or the local Gallery shelf; a repeated object id focuses that row; Retract peels the newest FaceMark or YawMark; Turn on an empty crate writes Level; Simulator seed already posts an ox-turned Furrow so the opening Stichos can file. Saved lists faced paintings and reviewable yaws; Settings credits the National Gallery, London; there is no grade field, no shop, and no WebView museum.

This is the app's marketed differentiator. It must be:

- visible on the home screen, not buried in settings;
- backed by real persisted data, not a cosmetic flourish;
- covered by at least one unit test;
- described in the README as the reason a user would pick this app.

## 13. AI-generated assets

Art style: **3D glass render glassmorphism · take artquiz10**


This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

Base prompt, reused and extended for every asset:

```
3D glass render, glassmorphism, studio-lit ox-plough furrow, a caption line of stichoi with every other word turned retrograde, refraction and soft bloom, isolated subjects, quiet uncluttered ground, hospitable daylight not a museum grid, no text, no letters, no logo, no photoreal stock, no specified colours, one furrow and a line of stichoi not a gap-prick slab, not a drum column, not a glued volumen, and not a hanging plaque
```

All 15 images below are required. Generate each one, export
as PNG, and add it to `Assets.xcassets` as its own image set named exactly as
given. Every name carries the `bph_` prefix.

### 13.1 App icon rules (strict)

The icon is rejected by App Store Connect if any of these are wrong:

- Exactly **1024 x 1024 px**.
- **No alpha channel.**
- sRGB colour profile, 8 bits per channel, PNG.
- **No text and no words** in the artwork.
- **No rounded corners and no built-in mask.**
- The subject stays inside the middle 80%.

### 13.3 Asset rules

- Cut-outs (everything except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop): isolated subject,
  real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. No square plate.
- Assets must be semantically different from each other.
- Record the exact prompt used for every asset in the README.
- SF Symbols are permitted only for close, chevron, share and similar system
  affordances.

Scanner frames, reticles, and seamless tiles are drawn in SwiftUI via `Path` or `Shape`. GenerateImage is not used for those. Every other in-app graphic (except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop) is a **cutout**: isolated SOLID opaque subject in the center, real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon is a fail. A hollow glass box or wire frame with a transparent center is a fail.

---

## 14. Demo data

Seed a small local demo dataset for this family's entities so Simulator
screenshots are not empty. The same seed must mark onboarding complete and
fill the primary surface — otherwise `-ReviewScreen` never fires. Never seed
on a physical device. Guard with `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` and
`bph.demo.v1`.

Seed the happy path: the home primary verb is enabled. The blocked / gated /
error state is a unit-test fixture, not Simulator home. Home chrome names the
job and the next tap in words a stranger knows. Axis values (`ui`, `naming`,
`architecture`) never become user-visible titles. A card that looks tappable
is a `Button`. A readout does not use button chrome.

---

## 16. Anti-patterns

The following will fail review:

- `try!`, `as!`, or force-unwrapping anything derived from the network, the
  database or a file.
- `fatalError` anywhere reachable at runtime. It is acceptable only for a
  programmer error in an initialiser that cannot fail in practice, and needs a
  comment.
- Swallowing an error with an empty `catch`.
- `print` used as production logging.
- A hard-coded hex colour outside the single colour accessor.
- A hard-coded font name outside the single typography accessor.
- An SF Symbol used as the app's brand iconography — the app icon, the
  empty-state hero, or onboarding art. Those come from section 13. SF Symbols
  are the right choice for every functional control (add, filter, sort,
  close, share, delete) — leaving those as bare text instead of a symbol is
  also a defect.
- Storing a value that can be computed (day totals, remaining budget, macro
  percentages).
- Blocking the main thread on disk or network work.
- `UIScreen.main` for sizing. Use the geometry the layout system gives you.
- Index positions used as list identity. Identity is a stable identifier.
- A view that reaches into the persistence layer directly, bypassing the
  architecture's designated seam.
- Business logic inside a `View` body or a `UIViewController` method, when the
  assigned architecture places it elsewhere.
- Copying a source file from another app in this batch.
- A `TabView` with exactly three tabs. That is the factory stamp — two or
  four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. ReviewScreen keys are
  not tabs.


---

## 17. Tests

Add a unit test target `BoustrophedonTests` covering at minimum:

1. The core domain invariant of this family (the thing that would be wrong if
   the calculator, decay, crate, or log lied).
2. Empty, populated and invalid input paths for the primary verb.
3. The section 12 twist logic.
4. One architecture-specific test proving the pattern holds.
5. A persistence round-trip: write, relaunch-equivalent reload, verify.
6. Parse `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` once after onboarding. 
   `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` switches the running app's live navigation. Extra cover slugs open those screens.
   Cover that parser with a unit test. Do not host a `View` in the test.

---

## 18. README.md

Write `README.md` at the app folder root covering:

1. What the app does and who it is for.
2. The architecture used and **why** it suits this product.
3. The unique feature added and how it works.
4. The AI art style and the exact prompt used for every asset.
5. How this app differs from others in the batch.
6. Build instructions.

Signing is off only on that command line. Do not put CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED, CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY or DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml — CI signs the archive. Leave CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic as the scaffold set it. The exact simulator does not matter — use any available UDID from the list.
